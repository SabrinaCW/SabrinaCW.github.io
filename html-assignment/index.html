                <h2>About Me </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Sabrina, I'm 26 years old, I came from Brazil. Canada is the first country I visit, I never left Brazil. I love my country for the cultural diversity it offers, for the typical foods and regional musical styles.<b> I like to say that Brazil has beautiful natural places to visit like Iguazu Falls and <em>Lençóis Maranhenses</em>.</b> I chose Canada for the culture and for a new experience in my life, I believe that the Interactive Media Design program can offer me new perspectives and experiences in the professional field.
